lab homework of 2021 spring Deep Learning and Practice class in NYCU

In this work, a conditional GAN model, using the CLEVR dataset, is built to generate synthetic object images with multi-label conditions. The images are included in the folder dataset/images. The generator, discriminator, and loss function are built follow DCGAN, SN-GAN, and WGAN, respectively.
